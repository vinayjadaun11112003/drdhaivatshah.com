                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><b> What is a tamponade?</b>
                    <br /> <br /> “Tamponade” is defined as the use of a tampon, which itself is defined as “a plug or
                    tent inserted tightly into a wound or orifice to arrest hemorrhage”. With regard to vitreoretinal
                    surgery, tamponade agents are used to provide surface tension across retinal breaks, which prevents
                    further fluid flow into the subretinal space until the retinopexy (photocoagulation or cryopexy)
                    gives a lasting chorioretinal attachment.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Introduction to vitreous substitutes </b>
                    <br /> <br /> Vitreous substitutes have been developed both as an intraoperative and as a
                    postoperative tool for the surgical treatment of complicated vitreoretinal diseases. The
                    effectiveness depends on the area of contact between the agent and the inner retinal surface, while
                    displacing the aqueous from the retinal surface. Physical parameters influencing this property
                    include-

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> (i) specific gravity
                    <br /> <br /> (ii) buoyancy
                    <br /> <br /> (iii) interfacial tension
                    <br /> <br /> (iv) viscosity

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> The choice of different intraocular tamponade agents depends on the

                    <br /> <br /> location of retinal break(s),
                    <br /> <br /> compliance of postoperative posture,
                    <br /> <br /> type of vitreoretinal disease(s), and
                    <br /> <br /> duration required for the tamponade
                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Characteristics of an Ideal Vitreous Substitute

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. Should mimicthe native vitreous
                    <br /> <br /> 2. Have similar viscoelastic properties
                    <br /> <br /> 3. Have similar refractive index and density
                    <br /> <br /> 4. Easy to manipulate during surgery

                    <br /> <br /> 5. Clear and transparent
                    <br /> <br /> 6. Biologically and chemically inert
                    <br /> <br /> 7. Hydrophilic and insoluble in water
                    <br /> <br /> 8. Biocompatible and nonbiodegradable
                    <br /> <br /> 9. Non toxic
                    <br /> <br /> 10. Be able to maintain the normal IOP to support the ocular tissues in proper
                    position
                    <br /> <br /> 11. Allow movement of ions and electrolytes and maintain the concentration of certain
                    substances (oxygen, lactic acid, and ascorbic acid)
                    <br /> <br /> 12. Readily available at reasonable cost
                    <br /> <br /> 13. Easy to store

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Types of Vitreous Substitutes</b>
                    <br /> <br /> Vitreous substitutes could be classified in different ways. A functional
                    classification referred to as the surgical application is described in the literature:
                    <br /> <br /> (i) As temporary fillers of vitreous cavity during the surgical procedure to maintain
                    the ocular tone;
                    <br /> <br /> (ii) As surgical tools themselves during different phases of vitreoretinal surgery,
                    requiring a short intraocular permanence;
                    <br /> <br /> (iii) As a therapeutic tool left inside the eye after vitreoretinal surgery with
                    different permanence time

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> There are three major categories of substitute based on a different
                    classification according to their
                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> molecular status –</b>
                    <br /> <br /> 1. Gases – most commonly used are air, sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) and
                    perfluoropropane (C 3 F 8 ).
                    <br /> <br /> 2. Liquids – Silicone Oil (SO) is the – most commonly used. Other examples are
                    perfluorocarbon
                    <br /> <br /> liquids, semifluorinated alkanes, Heavy Silicone Oil (HSO).
                    <br /> <br /> 3. Polymers like – hydrogels, smart hydrogels, and thermosetting hydrogels.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. GASES
                    <br /> <br /> I. Air

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> Air was the first gas injected into the eye. First used by Ohm in 1911 to
                    repair retinal detachment. Composed of different gases (mainly N 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , and others at
                    lower concentrations), it is-
                    <br /> <br /> Colorless and inert
                    <br /> <br /> Inexpensive and easily available
                    <br /> <br /> Non expansive
                    <br /> <br /> Low refractive index (approximately 1.00 nanometers), which causes complete light
                    reflection and therefore poor optical function i.e. fundus evaluation problematic until gas
                    reabsorption.
                    <br /> <br /> Easily diffuses in the blood circulation, reducing its tamponade effects in a few (3)
                    days.
                    <br /> <br /> Its tamponade effect depends on the dimension and the position of the intraocular
                    bubble, consequent to the position of the patient’s head.
                    <br /> <br /> Its use is limited to pneumatic retinopexy at the end of vitrectomy surgery and as an
                    emergency option.
                    <br /> <br /> ii. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) and Perfluoropropane (C 3 F 8 )

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> Both are heavier than air, colorless, odourless, nontoxic and expansile.
                    <br /> <br /> Two main characteristics of gases which help in reattaching the retina are
                    <br /> <br /> High Surface tension – which occludes the break
                    <br /> <br /> Buoyancy – which provides a force that pushes the retina back
                    <br /> <br /> SF 6 expands to about the double of the volume injected within 24 to 48 hours and
                    exerts an effect for 1 to 2 weeks whereas C 3 F 8 expands to about four times its original volume
                    within 72 to 96 hours and persists for 6 to 8 weeks.
                    <br /> <br /> Hence, commercially available at a definite non expansive concentration (SF 6 20% and
                    C 3 F 8 14%) in order to avoid errors during presurgical dilution.
                    <br /> <br /> Used as a non expansile mixture with air after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) while
                    during pneumoretinopexy used in 100% concentration as expansile gas.
                    <br /> <br /> In surgeries performed under general anesthesia, dinitrogen monoxide (N 2 O) is
                    strictly forbidden as anesthetic and analgesic due to its strong diffusion tendency. In such a case
                    the rapid vascular/eye exchange of these gases leads to a rapid expansion of the intraocular bubble
                    resulting in severe intraocular pressure rise.
                    <br /> <br /> Patients with intraocular gases are advised against air or high altitude travel for
                    about 2 weeks and 6 weeks following the administration of SF 6 and C 3 F 8 respectively, since the
                    reduction of atmospheric pressure will lead to expansion of intraocular gas bubble and cause
                    considerable increase of intraocular pressure.
                    <br /> <br /> At the same time they should avoid diving: the hyperbaric pressure occurring during
                    scuba diving causes hypotony and partial globe collapse.
                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Indications

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> Giant retinal tears
                    <br /> <br /> Retinal detachment complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy

                    <br /><br /><br /><br /> ii. Heavy silicone oil (HSO)

                    <br /><br /><br /> Heavy silicone oil is a tamponade agent formed from a mixture of SO and partially
                    fluorinated octane (PFA) that is heavier than water.
                    <br /><br /> Like silicone oils, they have good transparency, higher density than water, and higher
                    viscosity.
                    <br /><br /> Chemically inert and tendency of emulsification is less than that of silicone oils.
                    <br /><br /> Four molecules have been identified: Oxane HD, Densiron 68 and 68 LV, and HWS 46-3000.
                    <br /><br /> Used for complex retinal detachment involving the inferior part of the retina
                    complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
                    <br /><br /> Its removal requires strong active aspiration due to its high viscosity. The heavy SO
                    may remain strictly adherent to the retina surface (“sticky oil phenomenon”) causing inflammation
                    and tissue reactivity.
                    <br /><br />Complications include cataract, anterior segment inflammation, emulsification and
                    elevated IOP.
                    <br /><br />iii. Perfluorocarbon Liquids (PFCls)

                    <br /><br /><br /> A fluorochemical in which all the hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine.
                    <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;*clear, colorless, and odorless
                    <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp; *higher specific gravity than water
                    <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;*low viscosity favors easy introduction and removal
                    <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;*refractive index similar to that of water
                    <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;*hydrophobic and lipophobic and so immiscible but they could form emulsions
                    <br /><br /> Initially used in medicine when it was discovered to carry oxygen atoms in the same
                    manner as the blood.
                    <br /><br /> In 1987, Chang et al. used PFCL for the first time in retinal detachment with severe
                    proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
                    <br /><br /> During vitrectomy, PFCL flattens the detached retina and displaces the subretinal
                    fluid.
                    <br /><br /> Three molecules are nowadays in use:
                    <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;*perfluorodecalin (PFD),
                    <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;*perfluoro-n-octane (PFO)
                    <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;*Perfluoro-tetradecahydrophenantrene
                    <br /><br /> Used as temporary tamponades to unfold and stabilize the retina during surgical
                    manipulation. They have to be removed at the end of the surgical procedure due to its long-term
                    toxicity.
                    <br /><br /> Complications, if left into the eye after surgery include retinal toxicity and
                    intraocular inflammatory reactions, inducing the formation of epiretinal membranes and intraretinal
                    layer disruption, dispersion into multiple bubbles and residual droplets have been often observed a
                    long time after its removal.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>PATIENT PERSPECTIVE</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> The intraocular vitreous body is a highly complex macromolecular structure, and
                    despite significant progress over the past few decades, the ideal, universal vitreous substitute
                    does not exist. Vitreoretinal disorders constitute a significant portion of treatable ocular
                    disease. Advances in vitreoretinal surgery have included the development and characterization of
                    suitable substitutes for the vitreous. Air, perfluorocarbons, expansile gases, and silicone oil
                    serve integral roles in modern vitreoretinal surgery. These materials are used as intraoperative
                    instruments to re-establish intraocular volume, assist in separating membranes adherent to the
                    retina, manipulate retinal detachments and mechanically flatten detached retina. The final decision
                    regarding the type of tamponading agent to be used in a particular vitreoretinal surgery is solely
                    made by the operating surgeon taking into account the wide variation in their properties, clinical
                    functions, advantages and complications.
