                    <br /> <br /> <br /> As we know, retina is the light sensitive layer of the eye responsible for
                    vision. It is like a sheath or a thin blanket which is normally attached to the underlying retinal
                    pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroidal layer. Direct apposition of the retina to the RPE is
                    essential for normal retinal function. Whenever there is a break in this sheath like membrane, fluid
                    gets accumulated beneath and leads to a condition called retinal detachment.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>ETIOLOGY</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> Retinal detachment can be defined as the separation of the neurosensory retina
                    from the underlying RPE. The main cause of a Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD) is a retinal
                    ‘break’ or ‘hole’ which refers to a full thickness defect in the retina. A retinal ‘break’ allows
                    the inward movement of fluid from the vitreous cavity to the space under the retina (sub-retinal
                    space), resulting in retinal separation. Total RRD means complete detachment of the retina, while
                    subtotal detachment means a part of the retina is detached. When the retina is detached, the amount
                    of blood supply reaching it is minimal, as a result of which ischemia (death of tissue due to lack
                    of blood supply) could set in over a period of time. The longer it remains detached, more the
                    chances of ischemia and poorer the recovery post treatment. An important factor that governs vision
                    is whether the macula is attached or detached. If the macula is attached, the chances of vision gain
                    are more as compared to when the macula is detached.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>RISK FACTORS:</b>
                    <br /> <br /> There are various risk factors for RRD. These include –

                    <br /> <br /> 1. High myopia- A spectacle correction of up to -3D increases the risk of RRD by 4
                    times than in normal individuals. Myopia also causes vitreous degeneration to occur faster which
                    also increases the risk for RRD. A regular yearly check up of myopic patients is therefore
                    necessary. For patients undergoing refractive surgery for myopia, a retinal evaluation is a must
                    pre-op and if there is suspected lesion, it should be tackled with laser photocoagulation.
                    <br /> <br /> 2. Trauma- The sudden movement of the vitreous in blunt ocular trauma may lead to a
                    sudden pull on the peripheral retina leading to an extensive tearing of the retina around the base
                    of the vitreous. It can commonly lead to a giant retinal tear or a retinal dialysis.
                    <br /> <br /> 3. Intraocular Surgery- Any intraocular surgery like cataract surgery hastens
                    liquefaction of the vitreous humor. If there is a break anywhere in the retina, it can lead to RRD.
                    The risk of detachment is sevenfold after six years after cataract surgery, and the danger grows as
                    the postoperative time increases. The minimal risk of retinal detachment should be explained to
                    cataract patients before operation, but it is definitely not be a reason for cancelling surgery that
                    is indicated.
                    <br /> <br /> 4. Retinal degenerative lesion- Lattice degeneration is the most common degeneration
                    predisposing to RRD. It is seen in 6-8% people in the general population. Although lattice
                    degeneration is a risk factor for RRD, the large majority of patients with lattice lesions do not
                    develop RRD unless there are no additional holes or tears. Other peripheral retinal abnormalities
                    such as snail track degeneration (a variant of lattice degeneration) and cystic retinal tufts
                    commonly have focal areas of abnormal vitreoretinal adhesion and may predispose to retinal tears and
                    detachment. Hence, a routine retinal evaluation is must in people having these lesions.
                    <br /> <br /> 5. Laser capsulotomy- Post cataract surgery, sometimes there is opacification in the
                    lens for which laser capsulotomy is performed. Direct damage to the retina or vitreous changes like
                    posterior vitreous detachment secondary to the capsulotomy can occur which might lead to RRD.
                    <br /> <br /> 6. History of Chorioretinitis- Chorioretinitis and uveitis cause liquefaction of the
                    vitreous gel and cause formation of epiretinal membranes. These changes tend to precipitate retinal
                    detachment.
                    <br /> <br /> 7. RRD in the other eye/ family history- If a RRD has occurred in one eye of a person
                    who has an asymptomatic retinal lesion in the second eye, the chances of retinal detachment in the
                    other eye appear to be higher. Hence such lesions should be lasered before long. Also, it is said to
                    have a minor genetic predisposition, hence this aspect should be noted while taking history.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>SYMPTOMS</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> Most patients report abnormal phenomenon like ‘floaters’ and ‘flashes of light”
                    (photopsia) which are seen before the actual detachment. Floaters are seen due to vitreous opacities
                    and they are mobile and can be seen as floating black opacities which move with the movement of
                    eyeball. It is seen due to incomplete liquefaction of vitreous. They can be seen as cobwebs or
                    threads floating in front of the eye. Photopsias are flashes of lights seen due to incomplete
                    detachment of Posterior vitreous. This incomplete detachment causes a pull on the retina at the
                    places where it is attached which may stimulate the retina hence causing the visualization of light.
                    If the retina then becomes detached, the patient perceives a light to dark gray shadow; in few cases
                    the shadow is completely black. As opposed to floaters, this shadow does not move when the direction
                    of gaze changes. It feels as if a curtain has been drawn over the part of the eye where the
                    detachment has occurred. If this detachment involves the macular, a significant loss of vision can
                    occur immediately. Sometimes, due to the retinal detachment there can be a tear in one of the blood
                    vessels leading to vitreous hemorrhage which obscures the vision even more.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>SIGNS</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> Anterior Segment examination might reveal some flare and cells in the Anterior
                    Chamber. There may be a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) if the area of involvement is
                    large. Light reflex on Retinoscopy may be gray instead of the normal orange reflex. Patient may have
                    a visual field defect corresponding to the detached retina which may help guide the ophthalmologist
                    to look for the detachment. Examination of the entire fundus with Binocular Indirect Ophthalmoscope
                    (BIO) is necessary to document the detached retina and the possible causes like breaks or holes and
                    their numbers which will have to be sealed while undergoing surgery. On BIO, an acute detachment
                    looks like an elevated retina with loss of transparency due to which structures under the retina are
                    not visible, the margin of the detached and attached retina share a white line. An old RD looks
                    atrophic, with a pigmented demarcation line between detached and attached retina, with increased
                    opacification and thickened retinal folds known as Proliferative VitreoRetinopathy (PVR),
                    intraretinal cysts maybe seen as well. The Intra Ocular Pressure (IOP) may be low or high. Low IOP
                    may be due to increased outflow of intraocular fluid through subretinal space. The IOP may be high
                    in old RDs due to anterior migration of degenerated photoreceptor cell or RPE pigments which block
                    the normal trabecular outflow. This is known as Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> B scan- This is an ultrasonography of the eye which can be used to assess the
                    status of vitreous cavity and retina, choroid or sclera when it cannot be viewed directly under BIO.
                    B scan can be used to determine the presence or absence or RD, its location, macular involvement,
                    how old the RD is, presence of PVD. On B scan, RRD appears as a free floating membrane in the
                    vitreous cavity with high reflectivity on A scan having an attachment at the disc.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>PREVENTION</b>

                    <br /> <br /> Preventive measures can be taken for patients having conditions like Myopia,
                    peripheral retinal Degeneration or various syndromes. In these patients, routine examination may
                    reveal the presence of a tear or a hole in the peripheral retina. These breaks, holes and lattice
                    degeneration are usually treated with transconjunctival cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation. In
                    cryotherapy, a probe shaped like a pen whose tip is cooled to very low temperatures is applied on
                    the conjunctiva to freeze the retina through the outer layers of the eyeball. In laser
                    photocoagulation, a high-energy beam is delivered through the ocular media to the affected area.
                    Both these techniques cause an adhesion between the neurosensory retina and the Retinal Pigment
                    Epithelium thus preventing fluid from entering into the potential space and causing RD. Cryo is
                    relatively a painful procedure as compared to laser so is done under local anesthesia.

                    </div>
                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>SURGICAL MANAGEMENT</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main aim of surgical intervention is to reattach the retina to the
                    RPE and to close all the breaks found in the retina to prevent further chances of RD. This can be
                    done by applying pressure externally or internally to keep the retina attached to the RPE along with
                    laser or cryotherapy of the margins of the breaks. These techniques include –

                    <br /> <br /> 1. Scleral Buckling- This technique uses external tamponade to achieve a functional
                    closure of the retinal break with permanent retinal attachment by scleral indentation and
                    coagulation of retinal holes. The goal is to create an inward indentation of the eye wall, thus
                    approximating the retinal pigment epithelium to the neuroretina surrounding the break. Scleral
                    indentation is achieved by the placement of a buckle at a location corresponding to the retinal
                    break. The buckle is permanently anchored to the sclera with non-dissolvable sutures. Buckle
                    materials include silicone sponge and hard silicone that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The
                    exact type of buckle required varies according to the desired buckle (scleral indentation) height,
                    and location and number of breaks, and is to be decided by the operating surgeon.
                    <br /> <br /> 2. Pneumatic Retinopexy- In this technique, the retinal breaks/holes are sealed and a
                    gas bubble is injected into the vitreous cavity to provide an internal tamponade against the retina.
                    This technique is least invasive but also has a lower success rate as compared to the other
                    procedures and so the patient would have a higher chance of re-detachment.
                    <br /> <br /> 3. Vitrectomy- This is the latest technique, which involves removal of vitreous (jelly
                    inside the eye) which is causing traction on the retinal surface along with internal tamponade using
                    various agents like gas or silicone oil along with sealing of all breaks/holes with laser/cryo. The
                    gases/silicone oil replaces the vitreous and help in keeping the retinal adhered to the underlying
                    RPE. Along with this, they also help in maintaining the shape and structure of the eyeball after
                    removal of the vitreous. The common gases that can be used are air, perflouropropane (C3F8),
                    hexafluoride (SF6). Gases get absorbed over a period of time, while silicone oil needs to be removed
                    later on via a small procedure.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>POST OP CARE AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> The common post operative care that the patients have to take include taking
                    your medications as instructed by your doctor is to take adequate rest, to not rub or press your eye
                    and if instructed, wear protective glasses and an eye patch for when you sleep. Post operatively,
                    there may be some redness and discomfort initially for the first week but this all is expected and
                    is managed appropriately by medications. The patient may need to rest or sleep with their head in a
                    certain position (head down/lateral). It is important that they follow what their doctor told them
                    about head positions as it will help their eye recover from the surgery faster. It is important to
                    ask about number of days of avoidance of air travel if the doctor has placed gas inside the eye.
                    Avoiding strenuous activities is always better for three weeks at least post surgery.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><b> COMPLICATIONS</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the common complications includes raised Intraocular Pressure (IOP).
                    This is seen in almost 50% of patients and gives a feeling of discomfort, nausea, vomiting and
                    ocular pain to the patient. This rise in pressure may be temporary and can be managed medically.
                    Another complication that can be seen is Cataract development in phakic patients. Patient can have a
                    gradual fall in vision due to the cataract and may require a surgery for removal of the same after a
                    few months. Once the new intraocular lens is placed, the vision lost due to cataract can be
                    regained. Retinal re-detachment is also a complication that can happen in a few number of cases. A
                    sudden drop in vision post operatively should warrant you to visit your doctor immediately. The most
                    dreaded complication is infection of the eye known as Endophthalmitis. If you feel that the pain or
                    redness increases and there is a drop in vision along with discharge from the eye, you should visit
                    your doctor immediately.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>PATIENT PERSPECTIVE</b>

                    <br /> <br /> Sudden decrease of vision in one eye is an alarming condition for the patient. Early
                    visit to the doctor not only helps them to understand what happened inside the eye but also
                    increases the chances of gaining back good vision. The diagnosis of retinal detachment and a need
                    for retinal surgery may seem too overwhelming initially but early surgery will lead to a better
                    improvement in vision. Regular follow up by the patient is necessary for the doctor to assess the
                    progress of the condition. Post operatively, the vision improves gradually as the retina takes time
                    to function again. Different surgeries have a different recovery time but on an average it takes
                    about 2 to 6 weeks. So the patient should not be alarmed if the vision does not improve drastically
                    and immediately after the surgery.

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>CONCLUSION</b>

                    <br /> <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment is an emergency condition but
                    with swift and early management it can be treated and visual loss can be recovered. This requires
                    awareness and alertness not just among doctors but also patients who need to know when to seek
                    medical help. The goal is to identify and treat all the breaks and detachments and restore the
                    vision as much as possible. This requires an equal effort from the doctor as well as the patient.
